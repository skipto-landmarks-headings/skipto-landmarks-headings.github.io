    <h1>Why SkipTo?</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Keyboard Navigation and WCAG Bypass Blocks</h2>
      <div>
        <p>The <span class="keyword">SkipTo</span> extension and script both implement, albeit in different ways, long-standing browser and content accessibility requirements to provide keyboard navigation to the landmark regions and section headings of a web page. The definitions for these requirements are found in W3C WCAG Success Criterion 2.4.1, <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/bypass-blocks.html">Bypass Blocks</a>, and W3C UAAG Guideline 2.5, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/#gl-nav-structure">Structural Navigation</a>.</p>
        <p>Many people with disabilities cannot use a mouse or touchpad to navigate the content of a web page and thus rely on using only the keyboard for navigating web content with the browser. However, the built-in keyboard support in browsers is limited to the Tab key for navigating to links and form controls.</p>
        <p>The <span class="keyword">SkipTo</span> extension and script add additional keyboard support for navigating the landmarks and heading structure of a web page, a major improvement for accessing the non-interactive content of a page.</p>

      <h2>Headings Outline</h2>
      <div>
        <p>The <span class="keyword">SkipTo</span> menu includes an outline of the heading structure of a page for all users to view and use for page navigation. The outline provides a convenient way for users to get a comprehensive overview of the content on a page without having to scroll through the entire page.</p>
        <p>The outline makes the actual sections and subsections of the page visible, most of which are typically obscured when viewing only a portion of the page. The outline also provides an easy way for web content authors to check the heading structure of their pages to make sure they have properly identified the section and subsection groupings on the page.</p>

      <h2>Benefits to Screen Reader Users</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Screen reader software applications have built-in functions for separately viewing the landmark regions and headings of a page, but the <span class="keyword">SkipTo</span> menu provides additional benefits.</p>
        <p>By virtue of a unified and filtered list of the most frequently used landmark regions and top level headings, the screen reader user has access to a much shorter list of items to read in order to get to the most important parts of the page.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Importance of ARIA Landmark Regions</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Many designers, developers and people browsing the web are not familiar with ARIA landmark regions, but they are a powerful way to make web pages more accessible by identifying the layout and organization of a page for users of screen readers who cannot see the graphical rendering.</p>
        <p>Some HTML elements such as <span class="keyword">main</span>, <span class="keyword">nav</span>, <span class="keyword">aside</span>, <span class="keyword">header</span> and <span class="keyword">footer</span> define landmark regions automatically. Because of these automatic definitions, it is important for web designers and developers to understand how to create and use landmark regions to ensure they are meaningful and useful to users of screen readers.</p>
        <p>For more information on ARIA landmarks, please visit the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/">WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices</a> website.
